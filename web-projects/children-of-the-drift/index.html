    - header with logo and such, stays same on all pages (not to be confused with heading)
    - navigation bar, same as header
    - main, just the general content (unique) of the page, shouldn't be nested inside others
        - can include: article, sections, div, span (try to start each with a heading <h2> or such)
            div = block-level non-semantic element (doesn't tell the browser anything about it, just a way to bundle stuff)
            span = inline equivalent 
            try not to overuse them and if you do, add a class to it to make it targetable with CSS/JS
    - sidebar, some peripheral stuff like notes or further links (or ads?)
    - footer, copyright, fineprint, contact info, sometimes links elsewhere
